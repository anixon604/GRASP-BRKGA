# Linear-GRASP-BRKGA
Implementation of Linear Programming and meta-heuristics to solve scheduling

To Execute the BRKGA algorithm

1) Open the BRKGA_python directory
2) Keep all the python files in the same directory
3) Choose the dataset you want by uncommenting it or write an other one in DATA_DUMMY.py file. 	(You need to have all the datasets commented expect the one you want to use.)
4) Change the configuration of the chromosomes in CONFIGURATION.py
5) Just run the main.py file with "python main.py" in your console

To Execute the GRASP algorithm

1) Open the GRASP directory
2) Datasets are stored in data.py, the main program file is grasp.py
3) Choose you data set and parameters in the grasp.py, under main() function labeled #RUN PARAMS
4) Run "python grasp.py" in your console.
